The script has been tested only on the Huawei P10 Lite (WAS-LX1A)
and by default contains only the package data specific to that device.

Additional package data can be defined by the user.
Additional package data may be available in the future.

without internet access to prevent the application updates and ensure
a clean removal (remove the sim and don't enable the wi-fi).

Procedure:
 1 - Plug the smartphone to the computer
