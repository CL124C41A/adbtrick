The script has been tested only on my smartphone: WAS-LX1A 8.0.0.383(C432)
and the package listed are specific to that, don't expect it to work
reliably on any other thing.

It is recommended to execute this script after a factory reset performed
without internet access to prevent the application updates and ensure
a clean removal (remove the sim and don't enable the wi-fi).

Configure the script and set the right path to adb; the defaults assume
a platform-tools archive from google unpacked right next to the script.

Make sure your Powershell has local script execution enabled.

Make sure your smartphone has developer option enabled.

Enable USB debug after plugging in the smartphone.

Double-check all your settings and take a deep breath.

Start the script and confirm the fingerprint on the smartphone.

Now, it did either work or put your house on fire. Cheers.
